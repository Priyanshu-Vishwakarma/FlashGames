# FlashGames

FlashGames is a JavaScript-based web application that brings together multiple classic and strategy games under a single platform. The project emphasizes strong algorithmic foundations, particularly in problem-solving, game theory, and decision-making logic, while maintaining an interactive and user-friendly gameplay experience.

## Games Included

### Sudoku
- Generates valid and solvable Sudoku boards using recursion and backtracking
- Ensures efficient board creation with unique solutions
- Includes solution verification logic

### Tic-Tac-Toe
- Implements an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm
- Applies game theory concepts to make optimal moves
- Supports player vs AI gameplay

### Othello (Reversi)
- Turn-based strategy game with complete rule enforcement
- AI player designed using the Minimax algorithm
- Evaluates board states to maximize strategic advantage

### Dungeon Hunter
- Turn-based combat system
- Uses randomization and point-based mechanics to determine combat outcomes
- Focuses on basic game logic and decision-based outcomes

## Technical Overview
- Strong use of recursion and backtracking for combinatorial problem-solving
- Applied game theory and Minimax for AI-driven decision making
- Modular JavaScript code with clear separation of game logic
- Designed with scalability and readability in mind

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript (ES6)
- HTML5
- CSS3
